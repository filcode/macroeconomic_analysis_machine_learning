# Macroeconomic Machine Learning Model

The following repository is focused on the macroeconomic field, in particular a first step for analyzing and defining the data on the Eurostat website. Then, through the development of a special code, we moved on to data extraction. The need to develop an external code arose because Eurostat does not allow for the direct extraction of custom tables.

This analysis develops as follows:
- macro_data_extraction: shows how data are extracted and modeled to be structured in a single dataframe
- macro_outlier_analysis: analyze outlier with ml model Iso Forest and visualizations
- macro_trend_plot: Top-down analysis of the trend in recent years
- macro_lag_analysis: analyses correlations and cross corr. between variables in different time lags

The predictive part is currently unavailable for confidentiality reasons.
